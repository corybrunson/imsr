  abstract = {Mammography is the most effective method for breast cancer screening available today. However, the low positive predictive value of breast biopsy resulting from  mammogram interpretation leads to approximately 70\% unnecessary biopsies with benign  outcomes. To reduce the high number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several  computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been proposed in the last several years.  These systems help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a  suspicious lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short term follow-up  examination instead. We present two novel CAD approaches that both emphasize an  intelligible decision process to predict breast biopsy outcomes from BI-RADS  findings. An intelligible reasoning process is an important requirement for the  acceptance of CAD systems by physicians. The first approach induces a global model  based on decison-tree learning. The second approach is based on case-based reasoning  and applies an entropic similarity measure. We have evaluated the performance of  both CAD approaches on two large publicly available mammography reference databases  using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, bootstrap sampling, and the  ANOVA statistical significance test. Both approaches outperform the diagnosis  decisions of the physicians. Hence, both systems have the potential to reduce the  number of unnecessary breast biopsies in clinical practice. A comparison of the  performance of the proposed decision tree and CBR approaches with a state of the art  approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) shows that the CBR approach  performs slightly better than the ANN approach, which in turn results in slightly  better performance than the decision-tree approach. The differences are  statistically significant (p value {$<$} 0.001). On 2100 masses extracted from the DDSM  database, the CRB approach for example resulted in an area under the ROC curve of  A(z) = 0.89 +/- 0.01, the decision-tree approach in A(z) = 0.87 +/- 0.01, and the  ANN approach in A(z) = 0.88 +/- 0.01.},

The eXiT*CBR framework is proposed to  support the development of and experimentation with new case-based reasoning (CBR)  systems for medical diagnosis. METHOD: Our framework offers a modular, heterogeneous  environment that combines different CBR techniques for different application  requirements. The graphical user interface allows easy navigation through a set of  experiments that are pre-visualized as plots (receiver operator characteristics  (ROC) and accuracy curves). This user-friendly navigation allows easy analysis and  replication of experiments. Used as a plug-in on the same interface, eXiT*CBR can  work with any data mining technique such as determining feature relevance. RESULTS:  The results show that eXiT*CBR is a user-friendly tool that facilitates medical  users to utilize CBR methods to determine diagnoses in the field of breast cancer,  dealing with different patterns implicit in the data. CONCLUSIONS: Although several  tools have been developed to facilitate the rapid construction of prototypes, none  of them has taken into account the particularities of medical applications as an  appropriate interface to medical users. eXiT*CBR aims to fill this gap. It uses CBR  methods and common medical visualization tools, such as ROC plots, that facilitate  the interpretation of the results. The navigation capabilities of this tool allow  the tuning of different CBR parameters using experimental results. In addition, the  tool allows experiment reproducibility.},

A 15,000 patient data set, derived from electronic health records, is used to evaluate the approach. The predictive results show that the personalized models can outperform the global model.

In transductive systems a local model is developed for every new input vector, based on a certain number of data that are selected from the training data set and the closest to this vector. The weighted data normalization method (WDN) optimizes the data normalization ranges of the input variables for the model. A steepest descent algorithm is used for training the TWNFI models. The TWNFI is compared with some other widely used connectionist systems on two case study problems: Mackey\textendash Glass time series prediction and a real medical decision support problem of estimating the level of renal function of a patient. The TWNFI method not only results in a ``personalized'' model with a better accuracy of prediction for a single new sample, but also depicts the most significant input variables (features) for the model that may be used for a personalized medicine.

This article proposes a decision analysis method based on case-based reasoning, which aims to solve the emergency response problems for the prevention and control of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in urban rail transit. In this method, first, the historical cases are extracted and filtered by calculating the similarity between the target case and the historical case. A set of similar historical cases is constructed by setting the similarity threshold in advance. Second, comprehensive utility value of emergency response of each similar case is calculated referring to the utility evaluation of emergency response effect and response cost of each similar historical case. On this basis, the emergency plan of the target case is generated by selecting the emergency plans of the similar historical cases corresponding to the maximum comprehensive utility values of the emergency responses. Finally, with the emergency responses of COVID-19 in Tianjin rail transit as the background, this paper explains the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method within a case study.

Results  show that 47.2\% of the sample space can be predicted with an accuracy of 84.0\% and  attaining a high confidence level. 37.7\% of the sample space is classified with an  overall accuracy of 65.0\%. The remaining group was labeled as "undetermined". A  general prediction accuracy of 75.6\% is reached, exceeding the performance of other  approaches such as a backpropagation neural network and the Quest decision tree  program. Furthermore, by using this new method, more specifically case-based  reasoning, as a helpful tool to classify patients with early arthritis, the  possibility of a confidence measure is given, indicating a degree of "belief" of the  system in its results. This is often an important feature when dealing with  diagnosis in human patients.},

The methods of  setting constraints and Euclidean distance metric were used in CBR to search the  closest cases to the trial case based on the matrix. The usefulness of the algorithm  was tested on 32 new participants, and the accuracy of predicting return to work  outcomes was 62.5\%, which was no better than the 71.2\% accuracy derived from the  logistic regression model.

  abstract = {A nursing database which records patient details and treatments as fields in a standard database format is transformed into a collection, in text form, of patient  case days with history. Each case is represented as text strings encoding the  patient details, the current problems, treatments and their associated history. The  cosine measure of similarity is used to compute a whole case similarity between a  text query and the cases in text form. This standard text retrieval technique is  used and compared to a simple rule base. In case-based reasoning, the similarity of  cases is often computed by combining similarities of the case features involved. In  this work the standard text retrieval function is modified to incorporate this case  structure by combining individual matches of case components based on the cosine  measure. The combination is based on a linear regression model for learning the  weights assigned to the components of this retrieval function. For the 1355 records  two tasks were tried: predicting the treatment for a new problem and predicting the  treatment for a continuing problem when a change of treatment is required. Simple  text retrieval was better than the rule base for one task and case structured  retrieval was at least 18\% better on both tasks. Further techniques are discussed.},
