  abstract = {The need for appropriate ways to measure the distance or similarity between data is ubiquitous in machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining, but handcrafting such good metrics for specific problems is generally difficult. This has led to the emergence of metric learning, which aims at automatically learning a metric from data and has attracted a lot of interest in machine learning and related fields for the past ten years. This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the metric learning literature, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach. We pay particular attention to Mahalanobis distance metric learning, a well-studied and successful framework, but additionally present a wide range of methods that have recently emerged as powerful alternatives, including nonlinear metric learning, similarity learning and local metric learning. Recent trends and extensions, such as semi-supervised metric learning, metric learning for histogram data and the derivation of generalization guarantees, are also covered. Finally, this survey addresses metric learning for structured data, in particular edit distance learning, and attempts to give an overview of the remaining challenges in metric learning for the years to come.},

  abstract = {Background: The collection, storage, and analysis of large data sets are relevant in many sectors. Especially in the medical field, the processing of patient data promises great progress in personalized health care. However, it is strictly regulated, such as by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These regulations mandate strict data security and data protection and, thus, create major challenges for collecting and using large data sets. Technologies such as federated learning (FL), especially paired with differential privacy (DP) and secure multiparty computation (SMPC), aim to solve these challenges. Objective: This scoping review aimed to summarize the current discussion on the legal questions and concerns related to FL systems in medical research. We were particularly interested in whether and to what extent FL applications and training processes are compliant with the GDPR data protection law and whether the use of the aforementioned privacy-enhancing technologies (DP and SMPC) affects this legal compliance. We placed special emphasis on the consequences for medical research and development. Methods: We performed a scoping review according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). We reviewed articles on Beck-Online, SSRN, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and Google Scholar published in German or English between 2016 and 2022. We examined 4 questions: whether local and global models are ``personal data'' as per the GDPR; what the ``roles'' as defined by the GDPR of various parties in FL are; who controls the data at various stages of the training process; and how, if at all, the use of privacy-enhancing technologies affects these findings. Results: We identified and summarized the findings of 56 relevant publications on FL. Local and likely also global models constitute personal data according to the GDPR. FL strengthens data protection but is still vulnerable to a number of attacks and the possibility of data leakage. These concerns can be successfully addressed through the privacy-enhancing technologies SMPC and DP. Conclusions: Combining FL with SMPC and DP is necessary to fulfill the legal data protection requirements (GDPR) in medical research dealing with personal data. Even though some technical and legal challenges remain, for example, the possibility of successful attacks on the system, combining FL with SMPC and DP creates enough security to satisfy the legal requirements of the GDPR. This combination thereby provides an attractive technical solution for health institutions willing to collaborate without exposing their data to risk. From a legal perspective, the combination provides enough built-in security measures to satisfy data protection requirements, and from a technical perspective, the combination provides secure systems with comparable performance with centralized machine learning applications.},

Our approach is to enable hybrids of algorithms based on different computational formalisms to be executed. The architecture is motivated by some features of human cognitive architecture and the following beliefs: 1) Most existing computational methods often exhibit some of the characteristics desired of intelligent systems at the cost of other desired characteristics and 2) a system exhibiting robust intelligence can be designed by implementing hybrids of these computational methods. The main obstacle to this approach is that the various relevant computational methods are based on data structures and algorithms that are difficult to integrate into one system. We describe a new method of executing hybrids of algorithms using the focus of attention of multiple modules. The key to this approach is the following two principles: 1) Algorithms based on very different computational frameworks (e.g., logical reasoning, probabilistic inference, and case-based reasoning) can be implemented using the same set of five common functions and 2) each of these common functions can be executed using multiple data structures and algorithms. This approach has been embodied in the Polyscheme cognitive architecture. Systems based on Polyscheme in planning, spatial reasoning, robotics, and information retrieval illustrate that this approach to hybridizing algorithms enables qualitative and measurable quantitative advances in the abilities of intelligent systems.},

  abstract = {We say that an algorithm for nearest neighbor search is combinatorial if only direct comparisons between two pairwise similarity values are allowed. Combinatorial algorithms for nearest neighbor search have two important advantages: (1) they do not map similarity values to artificial distance values and do not use the triangle inequality for the latter, and (2) they work for arbitrarily complicated data representations and similarity functions. In this paper we introduce a special property of the similarity function on a set S that leads to efficient combinatorial algorithms for S. The disorder constant D(S) of a set S is defined to ensure the following inequality: if x is the a'th most similar object to z and y is the b'th most similar object to z, then x is among the D(S) (a + b) most similar objects to y. Assuming that disorder is small we present the first two known combinatorial algorithms for nearest neighbors whose query time has logarithmic dependence on the size of S. The first one, called Ranwalk, is a randomized zero-error algorithm that always returns the exact nearest neighbor. It uses space quadratic in the input size in preprocessing, but is very efficient in query processing. The second algorithm, called Arwalk, uses near-linear space. It uses random choices in preprocessing, but the query processing is essentially deterministic. For an arbitrary query q, there is only a small probability that the chosen data structure does not support q Finally, we show that for the Reuters corpus average disorder is indeed quite small and that Ranwalk efficiently computes the nearest neighbor in most cases.},

While clinical risk prediction tools have a long history in critical care, novel machine learning applications can offer improved predictive performance by maximally leveraging large-scale, complex EHR and other data [5]. Perhaps, even more importantly, these approaches may help overcome the problem of heterogeneity, which is routinely noted to be a hallmark of critical illness as well as a major barrier to improved treatment [11\textendash 13].

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials have traditionally been the gold standard against which all other sources of clinical evidence are measured. However, the cost of conducting these trials can be prohibitive. In addition, evidence from the trials frequently rests on narrow patient-inclusion criteria and thus may not generalize well to real clinical situations. Given the increasing availability of comprehensive clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs), some health system leaders are now advocating for a shift away from traditional trials and toward large-scale retrospective studies, which can use practice-based evidence that is generated as a by-product of clinical processes. Other thought leaders in clinical research suggest that EHRs should be used to lower the cost of trials by integrating point-of-care randomization and data capture into clinical processes. We believe that a successful learning health care system will require both approaches, and we suggest a model that resolves this escalating tension: a ``green button'' function within EHRs to help clinicians leverage aggregate patient data for decision making at the point of care. Giving clinicians such a tool would support patient care decisions in the absence of gold-standard evidence and would help prioritize clinical questions for which EHR-enabled randomization should be carried out. The privacy rule in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 may require revision to support this novel use of patient data.}

In the age of genomics, when individualization of care increasingly has become a major concern, investigating the relationship between population health, stratified medicine, and personalized therapy can improve our understanding of the ethical and biomedical implications of genomic medicine. I suggest that the need to optimize population health through population substructure-sensitive research and the need to individualize care through genetically targeted therapies are not necessarily incompatible.

Methods and material After a quick survey on the definition and on the role of context in artificial intelligence research, we have focused on CBR, with a particular emphasis on medical applications. In this field, we have identified a number of very recent contributions, which strongly recognize context per se as a major knowledge source. These contributions propose to maintain and to rely on contextual information, in order to support human reasoning in different fashions. Results We have distinguished three main directions in which contextual knowledge can be resorted to, in order to optimize physicians' decision making. Such directions can be summarized as follows: (1) to reduce the search space in the case retrieval step; (2) to maintain the overall knowledge content always valid and up to date, and (3) to adapt knowledge application and reasoning to local/personal constraints. We have also properly categorized the surveyed works within these three clusters, and identified the most significant ones, able to exploit contextual knowledge along more than one direction. Conclusions Innovative applications of the contextual knowledge recorded in the case library, described and systematized in this paper, can trace promising research directions for the future.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has succeeded in improving our daily routines by enabling automation and improved decision making in a variety of industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, resulting in increased efficiency and production. However, the development and widespread use of this technology has been significantly hampered by concerns about data privacy, confidentiality, and sensitivity, particularly in healthcare and finance. The ``data hunger'' of ML describes how additional data can increase performance and accuracy, which is why this question arises. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a technology that helps solve the privacy problem by eliminating the need to send data to a primary server and collect it where it is processed and the model is trained. To maintain privacy and improve model performance, FL shares parameters rather than data during training, in contrast to the typical ML practice of sending user data during model development. Although FL is still in its infancy, there are already applications in various industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and others. In addition, 32\% of companies have implemented or plan to implement federated learning in the next 12\textendash 24 months, according to the latest figures from KPMG, which forecasts an increase in investment in this area from USD 107 million in 2020 to USD 538 million in 2025. In this context, this article reviews federated learning, describes it technically, differentiates it from other technologies, and discusses current FL aggregation algorithms. It also discusses the use of FL in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Finally, the problems hindering progress in this area and future strategies to overcome these limitations are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Literature searches underlie the foundations of systematic reviews and related review types. Yet, the literature searching component of systematic reviews and related review types is often poorly reported. Guidance for literature search reporting has been diverse, and, in many cases, does not offer enough detail to authors who need more specific information about reporting search methods and information sources in a clear, reproducible way. This document presents the PRISMA-S (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension) checklist, and explanation and elaboration.                                         Methods               The checklist was developed using a 3-stage Delphi survey process, followed by a consensus conference and public review process.                                         Results               The final checklist includes 16 reporting items, each of which is detailed with exemplar reporting and rationale.                                         Conclusions               The intent of PRISMA-S is to complement the PRISMA Statement and its extensions by providing a checklist that could be used by interdisciplinary authors, editors, and peer reviewers to verify that each component of a search is completely reported and therefore reproducible.},

  abstract = {Undertaking a review of the literature is an important part of any research project. The researcher both maps and assesses the relevant intellectual territory in order to specify a research question which will further develop the knowledge base. However, traditional `narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can be biased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contradictory evidence has become progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has been questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process by synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge base and informing policymaking and practice. This paper evaluates the extent to which the process of systematic review can be applied to the management field in order to produce a reliable knowledge stock and enhanced practice by developing context-sensitive research. The paper highlights the challenges in developing an appropriate methodology.},

  abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms, such as K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), heav- ily rely on the distance metric for the input data patterns. Distance Metric learning is to learn a distance metric for the input space of data from a given collection of pair of similar/dissimilar points that preserves the distance relation among the training data. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated, both empirically and theoretically, that a learned metric can significantly improve the performance in classification, clustering and retrieval tasks. This paper surveys the field of dis- tance metric learning from a principle perspective, and includes a broad selection of recent work. In particular, distance metric learning is reviewed under different learning conditions: supervised learning versus unsupervised learning, learning in a global sense versus in a local sense; and the distance matrix based on linear kernel versus nonlinear kernel. In addition, this paper discusses a number of techniques that is central to distance metric learning, including convex programming, posi- tive semi-definite programming, kernel learning, dimension reduction, K Nearest Neighbor, large margin classification, and graph-based approaches.},
