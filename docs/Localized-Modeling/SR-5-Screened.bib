  abstract = {Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) represent the latest technological transformation in healthcare for assisting clinicians in complex decision-making. Several CDSSs are proposed to deal with a range of clinical tasks such as disease diagnosis, prescription management, and medication ordering. Although a small number of CDSSs have focused on treatment selection, areas such as medication selection and dosing selection remained under-researched. In this regard, this study represents one of the first studies in which a CDSS is proposed for clinicians who manage patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, almost all of whom have some manifestation of chronic kidney disease--mineral and bone disorder (CKD--MBD). The primary objective of the system is to aid clinicians in dosage prescription by levering medical domain knowledge as well existing practices. The proposed CDSS is evaluated with a real-world hemodialysis patient dataset acquired from Kyung Hee University Hospital, South Korea. Our evaluation demonstrates overall high compliance based on the concordance metric between the proposed CKD--MBD CDSS recommendations and the routine clinical practice. The concordance rate of overall medication dosing selection is 78.27\%. Furthermore, the usability aspects of the system are also evaluated through the User Experience Questionnaire method to highlight the appealing aspects of the system for clinicians. The overall user experience dimension scores for pragmatic, hedonic, and attractiveness are 1.53, 1.48, and 1.41, respectively. A service reliability for the Cronbach's alpha coefficient greater than 0.7 is achieved using the proposed system, whereas a dependability coefficient of the value 0.84 reveals a significant effect.},

  abstract = {The high incidence of stroke occurrence necessitates the understanding of its causes and possible ways for early prediction and prevention. In this respect, statistical methods offer the ``big picture,'' but they have a weak predictive ability at an individual level. This research proposes a new personalized modeling method based on computational spiking neural networks (SNN) for the identification of causal associations between clinical and environmental time series data that can be used to predict individual stroke events. The method is tested on 804 stroke patients. Given a clinical data set of patients who experienced a stroke in the past and the corresponding environmental time-series data for a selected time-window before the stroke event, the method identifies the clusters of individuals with a high risk for stroke under similar conditions. The methodology involves a pipeline of processes when creating a personalized model for an individual \$\$x\$\$: (1) selecting a group of individuals \$\$Gx\$\$with similar personal records to \$\$x\$\$; (2) training a personalized SNN \$\$x\$\$model of several days of environmental data related to the \$\$Gx\$\$group to predict the risk of stroke for \$\$x\$\$at least one day earlier; (3) model interpretability through 3D visualization; (4) discovery of personalized predictive markers. The results are twofold, first proposing a new computational methodology and second presenting new findings. It is found that certain environmental factors, such as SO2, PM10, CO, and PM2.5, increase the risk of stroke if an individual \$\$x\$\$belongs to a certain cluster of people, characterized by a combination of family history of stroke and diabetes, overweight, vascular/heart disease, age, and other. For the used population data, the proposed method can predict accurately individual risk of stroke before the day of the stroke. The paper presents a new methodology for personalized machine learning methods to define subgroups of the population with a high risk of stroke and to predict early individual risk of the stroke event. This makes the proposed cognitive computation method useful to reduce morbidity and mortality in society. The method is broadly applicable for predicting individual risk of other diseases and mental health conditions.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in cancer genomics is to distinguish the driver mutations that are causally linked to cancer from passenger mutations that do not contribute to cancer development. The majority of existing methods provide a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients. However, since mutation profiles of patients from the same cancer type show a high degree of heterogeneity, a more ideal approach is to identify patient-specific drivers.We propose a novel method that integrates genomic data, biological pathways and protein connectivity information for personalized identification of driver genes. The method is formulated on a personalized bipartite graph for each patient. Our approach provides a personalized ranking of the mutated genes of a patient based on the sum of weighted `pairwise pathway coverage' scores across all the samples, where appropriate pairwise patient similarity scores are used as weights to normalize these coverage scores. We compare our method against five state-of-the-art patient-specific cancer gene prioritization methods. The comparisons are with respect to a novel evaluation method that takes into account the personalized nature of the problem. We show that our approach outperforms the existing alternatives for both the TCGA and the cell line data. In addition, we show that the KEGG/Reactome pathways enriched in our ranked genes and those that are enriched in cell lines' reference sets overlap significantly when compared to the overlaps achieved by the rankings of the alternative methods. Our findings can provide valuable information toward the development of personalized treatments and therapies.All the codes and data are available at https://github.com/abu-compbio/PersonaDrive, and the data underlying this article are available in Zenodo, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6520187.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous syndrome prevalent among hospitalized patients. Personalized risk estimation and risk factor identification may allow effective intervention and improved outcomes.To develop and validate personalized AKI risk estimation models using electronic health records (EHRs), examine whether personalized models were beneficial in comparison with global and subgroup models, and assess the heterogeneity of risk factors and their outcomes in different subpopulations.This diagnostic study analyzed EHR data from 1 tertiary care hospital and used machine learning and logistic regression to develop and validate global, subgroup, and personalized risk estimation models. Transfer learning was implemented to enhance the personalized model. Predictor outcomes across subpopulations were analyzed, and metaregression was used to explore predictor interactions. Adults who were hospitalized for 2 or more days from November 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, were included in the analysis. Patients with moderate or severe kidney dysfunction at admission were excluded. Data were analyzed between August 28, 2019, and May 8, 2022.Clinical and laboratory variables in the EHR.The main outcome was AKI of any severity, and AKI was defined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine criteria. Performance of the models was measured with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve, and calibration.The study cohort comprised 76\,957 inpatient encounters. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 55.5 (17.4) years and included 42 159 men (54.8\%). The personalized model with transfer learning outperformed the global model for AKI estimation in terms of AUROC among general inpatients (0.78 [95\% CI, 0.77-0.79] vs 0.76 [95\% CI, 0.75-0.76]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and across the high-risk subgroups (0.79 [95\% CI, 0.78-0.80] vs 0.75 [95\% CI, 0.74-0.77]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and low-risk subgroups (0.74 [95\% CI, 0.73-0.75] vs 0.71 [95\% CI, 0.70-0.72]; P\,\&lt;\,.001). The AUROC improvement reached 0.13 for the high-risk subgroups, such as those undergoing liver transplant and cardiac surgery. Moreover, the personalized model with transfer learning performed better than or comparably with the best published models in well-studied AKI subgroups. Predictor outcomes varied significantly between patients, and interaction analysis uncovered modifiers of the predictor outcomes.Results of this study demonstrated that a personalized modeling with transfer learning is an improved AKI risk estimation approach that can be used across diverse patient subgroups. Risk factor heterogeneity and interactions at the individual level highlighted the need for agile, personalized care.},

  abstract = {Precision medicine aims to provide diagnosis and treatment accounting for individual differences. To develop machine learning models in support of precision medicine, personalized models are expected to have better performance than one-model-fits-all approaches. A significant challenge, however, is the limited number of labeled samples that can be collected from each individual due to practical constraints. Transfer Learning (TL) addresses this challenge by leveraging the information of other patients with the same disease (i.e., the source domain) when building a personalized model for each patient (i.e., the target domain). We propose Weakly-Supervised Transfer Learning (WS-TL) to tackle two challenges that existing TL algorithms do not address well: (i) the target domain has only a few or even no labeled samples; (ii) how to integrate domain knowledge into the TL design. We design a novel mathematical framework of WS-TL to learn a model for the target domain based on paired samples whose order relationships are inferred from domain knowledge, while at the same time integrating labeled samples in the source domain for transfer learning. Also, we propose an efficient active sampling strategy to select informative paired samples. Theoretical properties were investigated. Finally, we present a real-world application in precision medicine of brain cancer, where WS-TL is used to build personalized patient models to predict Tumor Cell Density (TCD) distribution across the brain based on MRI images. WS-TL has the highest accuracy compared to a variety of existing TL algorithms. The predicted TCD map for each patient can help facilitate individually optimized treatment. Note to Practitioners---This work was motivated by Precision Medicine applications that need to build personalized machine learning models to account for individual differences. Due to limited data from each person, Transfer Learning (TL) provides a promising approach, which can leverage the information of other patients with the same disease (i.e., the source domain) when building a personalized model for each patient (i.e., the target domain). The proposed WS-TL model addresses the application scenarios with two unique properties: (i) the target domain has a few and even no labeled samples, which is a challenging situation that most existing TL methods do not address well; (ii) there is domain knowledge to provide weak labels for a large number of unlabeled samples in the form of order relationships, which provides an opportunity to integrate the domain knowledge into the TL design. We demonstrate WS-TL in a Precision Medicine application for brain cancer and show promising results. WS-TL has the potential of addressing a broad range of other application areas in building personalized models.},

  abstract = {Decision making on the treatment of vestibular schwannoma (VS) is mainly based on the symptoms, tumor size, patient's preference, and experience of the medical team. Here we provide objective tools to support the decision process by answering two questions: can a single checkup predict the need of active treatment?, and which attributes of VS development are important in decision making on active treatment? Using a machine-learning analysis of medical records of 93 patients, the objectives were addressed using two classification tasks: a time-independent case-based reasoning (CBR), where each medical record was treated as independent, and a personalized dynamic analysis (PDA), during which we analyzed the individual development of each patient's state in time. Using the CBR method we found that Koos classification of tumor size, speech reception threshold, and pure tone audiometry, collectively predict the need for active treatment with approximately 90\% accuracy; in the PDA task, only the increase of Koos classification and VS size were sufficient. Our results indicate that VS treatment may be reliably predicted using only a small set of basic parameters, even without the knowledge of individual development, which may help to simplify VS treatment strategies, reduce the number of examinations, and increase cause effectiveness.},
