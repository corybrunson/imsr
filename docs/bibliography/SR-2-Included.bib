Based on growing cell structure artificial neural networks, this  paper presents a method that automatically constructs a case retrieval model from  existing data.

  abstract = {Approximately 70-85\% of breast biopsies are performed on benign lesions. To reduce this high number of biopsies performed on benign lesions, a case-based reasoning  (CBR) classifier was developed to predict biopsy results from BI-RADS findings. We  used 1433 (931 benign) biopsy-proven mammographic cases. CBR similarity was defined  using either the Hamming or Euclidean distance measure over case features. Ten  features represented each case: calcification distribution, calcification  morphology, calcification number, mass margin, mass shape, mass density, mass size,  associated findings, special cases, and age. Performance was evaluated using Round  Robin sampling, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and bootstrap. To  determine the most influential features for the CBR, an exhaustive feature search  was performed over all possible feature combinations (1022) and similarity  thresholds. Influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring  features in the feature subsets with the highest partial ROC areas (0.90AUC). For  CBR with Hamming distance, the most influential features were found to be mass  margin, calcification morphology, age, calcification distribution, calcification  number, and mass shape, resulting in an 0.90AUC of 0.33. At 95\% sensitivity, the  Hamming CBR would spare from biopsy 34\% of the benign lesions. At 98\% sensitivity,  the Hamming CBR would spare 27\% benign lesions. For the CBR with Euclidean distance,  the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin, calcification  morphology, age, mass density, and associated findings, resulting in 0.90AUC of  0.37. At 95\% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare from biopsy 41\% benign  lesions. At 98\% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare 27\% benign lesions. The  profile of cases spared by both distance measures at 98\% sensitivity indicates that  the CBR is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for the classification of  mammographic lesions, by recommending short-term follow-up for likely benign lesions  that is in agreement with final biopsy results and mammographer's intuition.}

We adopted this formalism for  predicting whether biopsy results of mammographic masses will be benign or  malignant, aiming to reduce the number of biopsies performed on benign lesions. We  compared the performance of this LR-based algorithm (LRb) to a case-based reasoning  (CBR) classifier, which provides a solution to a new problem using past similiar  cases. Each classifier used mammographers' BI-RADS descriptions of mammographic  masses as input. The database consisted of 646 biopsy-proven mammography cases.  Performance was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis,  Round Robin sampling, and bootstrap. The ROC areas (AUC) for the LRb and CBR were  0.91+/- 0.01 and 0.92 +/- 0.01, respectively. The partial ROC area index (0.90AUC)  was the same for both classifiers, 0.59 +/- 0.05. At a sensitivity of 98\%, the CBR  would spare 204 (49\%) of benign lesions from biopsy; the LRb would spare 209 (51\%)  benign lesions. The performance of the two classifiers was very similar, with no  statistical differences in AUC or 0.90AUC. Although the CBR and LRb originate from  different fields of study, their implementations differ only in the estimation of  the probability density functions (PDFs) of the feature distributions. The CBR  performs this estimation implicitly, while using various similarity metrics. On the  other hand, the estimation of the PDFs is specified explicitly in the LRb  implementation. This difference in the estimation of the PDFs results in the very  small difference in performance, and at 98\% sensitivity, both classifiers would  spare about half of the benign mammographic masses from biopsy. The CBR and LRb are  equivalent methods in implementation and performance.}

METHODS:  Inducing similarity measure through special linear transformations of the  referencing sets aimed at the best separation of these sets. Designing separable  transformations can be based on dipolar models and minimization of the convex and  piecewise linear (CPL) criterion functions in accordance with the basis exchange  algorithm. RESULTS: Separable linear transformations allow for some data sets to  decrease the error rate of the K-N classification rule based on the Euclidean  distance. Such results can be seen on the example of data sets taken from the Hepar  system of diagnosis support.

We developed an  ontological paradigm to represent knowledge of a patient's oral conditions and  denture component parts. During the case-based reasoning process, a cosine  similarity algorithm was applied to calculate similarity values between input  patients and standard ontology cases. A group of designs from the most similar cases  were output as the final results. To evaluate this model, the output designs of RPDs  for 104 randomly selected patients were compared with those selected by  professionals. An area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic  (AUC-ROC) was created by plotting true-positive rates against the false-positive  rate at various threshold settings. The precision at position 5 of the retrieved  cases was 0.67 and at the top of the curve it was 0.96, both of which are very high.  The mean average of precision (MAP) was 0.61 and the normalized discounted  cumulative gain (NDCG) was 0.74 both of which confirmed the efficient performance of  our model. All the metrics demonstrated the efficiency of our model. This  methodology merits further research development to match clinical applications for  designing RPDs. This paper is organized as follows. After the introduction and  description of the basis for the paper, the evaluation and results are presented in  Section 2. Section 3 provides a discussion of the methodology and results. Section 4  describes the details of the ontology, similarity algorithm, and application.}

There is an  urgent need for better diagnostic instruments for the assessment of acute  graft-versus-host disease. In the present study, a novel bioinformatics framework  was used to identify gene expression patterns associated with acute graft-versushost  disease in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood cells were collected prospectively from  patients who did develop acute graftversus-host disease (YES) and from those who did  not (NO). Gene expression profiling was performed using a panel of 47 candidate  genes potentially involved in alloreactive responses. The entire population of  YES/NO acute graft-versus-host disease patients formed the experimental validation  set. Personalized modeling based on a gene selection technique was applied to  identify the most significant mRNA transcripts, which were then used to profile  individual data samples for training and testing the classification/prediction  framework. RESULTS: A leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was performed to  investigate the robustness of the classification framework producing the following  results: 100\% on the training dataset and 97\% on the testing dataset. According to  our integrated methodology, transcripts for FOXP3, ICOS, CD52 and CASP1, genes  involved in immune alloreactive responses and participating in immune cell  interactions, were identified as the most informative biomarkers in allogeneic stem  cell transplant recipients experiencing acute graft-versus-host disease.  CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the integrated methodology proposed is  useful for the selection of valid gene targets for the diagnosis of acute  graft-versus-host disease, producing satisfactory accuracy over independent clinical  features of the allogeneic transplanted population.}

  abstract = {Mammography is the most effective method for breast cancer screening available today. However, the low positive predictive value of breast biopsy resulting from  mammogram interpretation leads to approximately 70\% unnecessary biopsies with benign  outcomes. To reduce the high number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several  computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been proposed in the last several years.  These systems help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a  suspicious lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short term follow-up  examination instead. We present two novel CAD approaches that both emphasize an  intelligible decision process to predict breast biopsy outcomes from BI-RADS  findings. An intelligible reasoning process is an important requirement for the  acceptance of CAD systems by physicians. The first approach induces a global model  based on decison-tree learning. The second approach is based on case-based reasoning  and applies an entropic similarity measure. We have evaluated the performance of  both CAD approaches on two large publicly available mammography reference databases  using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, bootstrap sampling, and the  ANOVA statistical significance test. Both approaches outperform the diagnosis  decisions of the physicians. Hence, both systems have the potential to reduce the  number of unnecessary breast biopsies in clinical practice. A comparison of the  performance of the proposed decision tree and CBR approaches with a state of the art  approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) shows that the CBR approach  performs slightly better than the ANN approach, which in turn results in slightly  better performance than the decision-tree approach. The differences are  statistically significant (p value {$<$} 0.001). On 2100 masses extracted from the DDSM  database, the CRB approach for example resulted in an area under the ROC curve of  A(z) = 0.89 +/- 0.01, the decision-tree approach in A(z) = 0.87 +/- 0.01, and the  ANN approach in A(z) = 0.88 +/- 0.01.}

  abstract = {Background: Clinical risk prediction models (CRPMs) use patient characteristics to estimate the probability of having or developing a particular disease and/or outcome. While CRPMs are gaining in popularity, they have yet to be widely adopted in clinical practice. The lack of explainability and interpretability has limited their utility. Explainability is the extent of which a model's prediction process can be described. Interpretability is the degree to which a user can understand the predictions made by a model. Methods: The study aimed to demonstrate utility of patient similarity analytics in developing an explainable and interpretable CRPM. Data was extracted from the electronic medical records of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia in a Singapore public primary care clinic. We used modified K-nearest neighbour which incorporated expert input, to develop a patient similarity model on this real-world training dataset (n = 7,041) and validated it on a testing dataset (n = 3,018). The results were compared using logistic regression, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models from the same dataset. The patient similarity model was then implemented in a prototype system to demonstrate the identification, explainability and interpretability of similar patients and the prediction process. Results: The patient similarity model (AUROC = 0.718) was comparable to the logistic regression (AUROC = 0.695), RF (AUROC = 0.764) and SVM models (AUROC = 0.766). We packaged the patient similarity model in a prototype web application. A proof of concept demonstrated how the application provided both quantitative and qualitative information, in the form of patient narratives. This information was used to better inform and influence clinical decision-making, such as getting a patient to agree to start insulin therapy. Conclusions: Patient similarity analytics is a feasible approach to develop an explainable and interpretable CRPM. While the approach is generalizable, it can be used to develop locally relevant information, based on the database it searches. Ultimately, such an approach can generate a more informative CRPMs which can be deployed as part of clinical decision support tools to better facilitate shared decision-making in clinical practice.

To assess the potential of  this approach for kidney transplant recipients, where recognition of acute  rejections is based on the pattern of changes in serum creatinine. DESIGN: We  developed a case-based reasoning algorithm using dynamic time-warping as the measure  of similarity which allows comparison of series of infrequent measurements at  irregular intervals for retrieval of the most similar historical cases for the  assessment of a new situation. MEASUREMENTS: The ability to recognize creatinine  courses associated with an acute rejection was tested for a set of cases from a  database of transplant patient records and compared with the diagnostic performance  of experienced physicians. Tests were performed with case bases of various sizes.  RESULTS: The accuracy of the algorithm increased steadily with the size of the  available case base. With the largest case bases, the case-based algorithm reached  an accuracy of 78 +/- 2\%, which is significantly higher than the performance of  experienced physicians (69 +/- 5.3\%) (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: The new case-based  reasoning algorithm with dynamic time warping as the measure of similarity allows  extension of the use of automatic laboratory alerting systems to conditions in which  abnormal laboratory results are the norm and critical states can be detected only by  recognition of pathological changes over time.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop an approach to the prediction of survival in patients with colorectal cancer using nearest neighbor analysis and case-based reasoning. STUDY  DESIGN: A total of 216 patients with full clinicopathologic records and five-year  follow-up were the subjects of this study. They were divided into a core database of  162 cases and a test group of 54 cases, with follow-up on all patients. When the  patient was still alive at the end of the follow-up period, censored survival time  was used. For each of the test cases, the four closest neighbors from the database  were retrieved and their median survival time recorded and used as the predicted  estimate of survival. Case matching was based on a Euclidean multivariate distance  measure for the three best predictor variables: patient age, Dukes stage and tubule  configuration. Cases with the smallest distance from the test case were considered  to be the most similar. The predicted survival times for the test cases were  compared with the actual, observed survival in the test cases to determine the  success of this approach. RESULTS: The results showed reasonable concordance between  observed and predicted survival figures, although there was a large degree of  spread. Classification of cases into {$<$} or = 60 and {$>$} 60 months' survival showed a  correct classification rate of 63\%. For the prediction of survival time, the  distribution of differences between observed and predicted survival times for the  uncensored test cases had a median value of--5 months but also showed a wide  dispersion of values. Correlation of observed and predicted survival times, while  not reaching statistical significance at P {$<$} .05, did show a strong positive  association. CONCLUSION: Case-based approaches to the prediction of survival times  in cancer patients are important. The results of the current study illustrate the  difficulties in applying this approach to survival data and highlight the complexity  of patient information and the inability to accurately predict patient outcome on a  small subset of clinicopathologic features. While extensive work needs to be carried  out to improve prediction power, this study illustrates the potential for case-based  analyses. The ability to retrieve feature-matched cases from hospital patient  databases has clear, independent advantages in patient management, but the ability  to provide reliable, targeted prognostic estimates on individual cases should be a  common goal in medical research.}

  abstract = {Histopathology is crucial to diagnosis of cancer, yet its interpretation is tedious and challenging. To facilitate this procedure, content-based image retrieval methods  have been developed as case-based reasoning tools. Especially, with the rapid growth  of digital histopathology, hashing-based retrieval approaches are gaining popularity  due to their exceptional efficiency and scalability. Nevertheless, few hashing-based  histopathological image analysis methods perform feature fusion, despite the fact  that it is a common practice to improve image retrieval performance. In response, we  exploit joint kernel-based supervised hashing (JKSH) to integrate complementary  features in a hashing framework. Specifically, hashing functions are designed based  on linearly combined kernel functions associated with individual features.  Supervised information is incorporated to bridge the semantic gap between low-level  features and high-level diagnosis. An alternating optimization method is utilized to  learn the kernel combination and hashing functions.

The eXiT*CBR framework is proposed to  support the development of and experimentation with new case-based reasoning (CBR)  systems for medical diagnosis. METHOD: Our framework offers a modular, heterogeneous  environment that combines different CBR techniques for different application  requirements. The graphical user interface allows easy navigation through a set of  experiments that are pre-visualized as plots (receiver operator characteristics  (ROC) and accuracy curves). This user-friendly navigation allows easy analysis and  replication of experiments. Used as a plug-in on the same interface, eXiT*CBR can  work with any data mining technique such as determining feature relevance. RESULTS:  The results show that eXiT*CBR is a user-friendly tool that facilitates medical  users to utilize CBR methods to determine diagnoses in the field of breast cancer,  dealing with different patterns implicit in the data. CONCLUSIONS: Although several  tools have been developed to facilitate the rapid construction of prototypes, none  of them has taken into account the particularities of medical applications as an  appropriate interface to medical users. eXiT*CBR aims to fill this gap. It uses CBR  methods and common medical visualization tools, such as ROC plots, that facilitate  the interpretation of the results. The navigation capabilities of this tool allow  the tuning of different CBR parameters using experimental results. In addition, the  tool allows experiment reproducibility.}

Current IT solutions are far away from this perspective  since they typically have difficulty supporting the variances occurring in clinical  practices, and providing adequate flexible support of clinical processes. METHODS:  This paper proposes a hybrid approach based on rough set theory and case-based  reasoning to allow physicians to rapidly adjust patients' treatment processes to  changes of patients' clinical states. In detail, the proposed approach recommends  appropriate treatment plans in clinical process execution by adopting a similarity  measure to select appropriate clinical treatment plans executed on patients who  presented similar features to the current one. Such clinical treatment plans are  then applied to suggest which actions to perform next in clinical treatment process  execution. RESULTS: As a motivating scenario, this study performs the experiments of  type 2 diabetes patient's treatment process. The results show that the proposed  approach is feasible to recommend suitable clinical treatment plans in clinical  process execution, which makes adaptive clinical treatment processes possible.}

An urgent need exists for a system and a set of biomarkers that provide an  accurate diagnosis. In this paper, a novel Case Based Reasoning framework with  gradient boosting based feature selection is proposed and applied to the task of  squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma discrimination, aiming to provide  accurate diagnosis with a reduced set of genes. The proposed method was trained and  evaluated on two independent datasets to validate its generalization capability.  Furthermore, it achieved accuracy rates greater than those of traditional microarray  analysis techniques, incorporating the advantages inherent to the Case Based  Reasoning methodology (e.g. learning over time, adaptability, interpretability of  solutions, etc.).}

In transductive systems a local model is developed for every new input vector, based on a certain number of data that are selected from the training data set and the closest to this vector. The weighted data normalization method (WDN) optimizes the data normalization ranges of the input variables for the model. A steepest descent algorithm is used for training the TWNFI models. The TWNFI is compared with some other widely used connectionist systems on two case study problems: Mackey\textendash Glass time series prediction and a real medical decision support problem of estimating the level of renal function of a patient. The TWNFI method not only results in a ``personalized'' model with a better accuracy of prediction for a single new sample, but also depicts the most significant input variables (features) for the model that may be used for a personalized medicine.

In this method, first, the historical cases are extracted and filtered by calculating the similarity between the target case and the historical case. A set of similar historical cases is constructed by setting the similarity threshold in advance. Second, comprehensive utility value of emergency response of each similar case is calculated referring to the utility evaluation of emergency response effect and response cost of each similar historical case. On this basis, the emergency plan of the target case is generated by selecting the emergency plans of the similar historical cases corresponding to the maximum comprehensive utility values of the emergency responses. Finally, with the emergency responses of COVID-19 in Tianjin rail transit as the background, this paper explains the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method within a case study.

In  this work the standard text retrieval function is modified to incorporate this case  structure by combining individual matches of case components based on the cosine  measure. The combination is based on a linear regression model for learning the  weights assigned to the components of this retrieval function. For the 1355 records  two tasks were tried: predicting the treatment for a new problem and predicting the  treatment for a continuing problem when a change of treatment is required. Simple  text retrieval was better than the rule base for one task and case structured  retrieval was at least 18\% better on both tasks. Further techniques are discussed.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The overlap between probable migraine (PM) and probable tension-type headache (PTTH) often confuses physicians in clinical practice. Although clinical  decision support systems (CDSSs) have been proven to be helpful in the diagnosis of  primary headaches, the existing guideline-based headache disorder CDSSs do not  perform adequately due to this overlapping issue. Thus, in this study, a CDSS based  on case-based reasoning (CBR) was developed in order to solve this problem. METHODS:  First, a case library consisting of 676 clinical cases, 56.95\% of which had been  diagnosed with PM and 43.05\% of which had been diagnosed with PTTH, was constructed,  screened by a three-member panel, and weighted by engineers. Next, the resulting  case library was used to diagnose current cases based on their similarities to the  previous cases. The test dataset was composed of an additional 222 historical cases,  76.1\% of which had been diagnosed with PM and 23.9\% of which had been diagnosed with  PTTH. The cases that comprised the case library as well as the test dataset were  actual clinical cases obtained from the International Headache Center in Chinese PLA  General Hospital. RESULTS: The results indicated that the PM and PTTH recall rates  were equal to 97.02\% and 77.78\%, which were 34.31\% and 16.91\% higher than that of  the guideline-based CDSS, respectively. Furthermore, the PM and PTTH precision rates  were equal to 93.14\% and 89.36\%, which were7.09\% and 15.68\% higher than that of the  guideline-based CDSS, respectively. Comparing CBR CDSS and guideline-based CDSS, the  p-value of PM diagnoses was equal to 0.019, while that of PTTH diagnoses was equal  to 0.002, which indicated that there was a significant difference between the two  approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results indicated that the CBR CDSS  developed in this study diagnosed PM and PTTH with a high degree of accuracy and  performed better than the guideline-based CDSS. This system could be used as a  diagnostic tool to assist general practitioners in distinguishing PM from PTTH.}

  abstract = {Blood glucose (BG) prediction is an effective approach to avoid hyper- and hypoglycemia, and achieve intelligent glucose management for patients with type 1 or serious type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have tended to adopt deep learning networks to obtain improved prediction models and more accurate prediction results, which have often required significant quantities of historical continuous glucose-monitoring (CGM) data. However, for new patients with limited historical dataset, it becomes difficult to establish an acceptable deep learning network for glucose prediction. Consequently, the goal of this study was to design a novel prediction framework with instance-based and network-based deep transfer learning for cross-subject glucose prediction based on segmented CGM time series. Taking the effects of biodiversity into consideration, dynamic time warping (DTW) was applied to determine the proper source domain dataset that shared the greatest degree of similarity for new subjects. After that, a network-based deep transfer learning method was designed with cross-domain dataset to obtain a personalized model combined with improved generalization capability. In a case study, the clinical dataset demonstrated that, with additional segmented dataset from other subjects, the proposed deep transfer learning framework achieved more accurate glucose predictions for new subjects with type 2 diabetes.}
